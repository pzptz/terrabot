Transit-Accessible Activity Recommendation Bot
A Discord bot that recommends activities near a given location that are accessible by public transit. The bot leverages Mistral AI for natural language processing, OpenStreetMap APIs for location and transit data, and OpenWeatherMap for current weather conditions.

Technology Stack

Discord.py: Bot framework for Discord integration
Mistral AI: Large language model for generating recommendations
OpenStreetMap:

Nominatim API: Geocoding (location to coordinates)
Overpass API: Finding points of interest


OpenRouteService: Public transit routing information
OpenWeatherMap API: Current weather data
GeoPy: Geocoding and reverse geocoding library

Advantages of the Open-Source Approach

Completely free: No billing setup or credit card required
No API quotas: The OpenStreetMap ecosystem doesn't require API keys for basic usage
Global coverage: Often better coverage in regions outside the US
Community-maintained data: Frequently updated by local contributors

Limitations

Transit routing information may be limited in some regions
API response times may be slower than commercial alternatives
Weather data might not be available for all locations
